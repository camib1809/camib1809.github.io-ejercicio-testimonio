                <p class="card-text opacity-50">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
                  looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed
                  up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                  weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
                  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

            <p class="card-text opacity-80">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed
              some structure from
              professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
              did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
              project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
              could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
              experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
              100% recommend! ”</p>
